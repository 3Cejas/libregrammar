    (source: https://extensions.libreoffice.org/extensions/swedish-spelling-dictionary-den-stora-svenska-ordlistan)

#### General
  * `spelling_global.txt` has been added. Words or phrases added here will
    be accepted for all languages.
  * `prohibit_custom.txt` and `spelling_custom.txt` can be used to make your
    own additions to `spelling.txt` and `prohibit.txt` without having to edit those
    files after a `LanguageTool` update (you will still need to manually copy those
    files).  
    Paths to these files (`xx` = language code):  
    `./org/languagetool/resource/xx/hunspell/prohibit_custom.txt`
    `./org/languagetool/resource/xx/hunspell/spelling_custom.txt`  
    Note that you can simply create these files if they don't exist for your language yet.
  * The unmaintained code from package `org.languagetool.dev.wikipedia.atom`
    has been removed. It hadn't been maintained for years and didn't work properly
    anymore.

  * several bug fixes, thanks to Fred Kruse.

#### HTTP API / LT server
  * The dynamic languages feature (`lang-xx=...` and `lang-xx-dictPath=...`) now
    also supports hunspell dictionaries. Just let `lang-xx-dictPath` point to the
    absolute path of the `.dic` file. Note that hunspell is quite slow when it
    comes to offering suggestions for misspelled words.

#### Java API
  * `AbstractSimpleReplaceRule2` has been fixed so that it's now case-insensitive.
    If you implement a sub class of it and you want the old behavior, please implement
    `isCaseSensitive()` and have it return `true`. (Issue #2051)

#### Internal
  * The internal hunspell has been updated from 1.3 to 1.7, now using
    https://gitlab.com/dumonts/hunspell-java as the project providing the bindings, thanks to Daniel Naber.
    E.g., for Portuguese, misspellings suggestions generation is three times faster,
    although it is still slower than the lighter Morfologik methods.
  * Experimental: the new `default="temp_off"` attribute in `grammar.xml` files will
    turn off a rule/rulegroup, but keep it activated for our nightly regression tests.
  * Many external dependencies have been updated to new versions
