#### General
  * The unmaintained code from package `org.languagetool.dev.wikipedia.atom`
    has been removed. It hadn't been maintained for years and didn't work properly
    anymore.

#### LibreOffice / Apache OpenOffice Integration
  * 'disable rule' option added to context menu.
 
#### Java API
  * `AbstractSimpleReplaceRule2` has been fixed so that it's now case-insensitive.
    If you implement a sub class of it and you want the old behavior, please implement
    `isCaseSensitive()` and have it return `true`. (Issue #2051)

#### HTTP API / LT server
  * The dynamic languages feature (`lang-xx=...` and `lang-xx-dictPath=...`) now
    also supports hunspell dictionaries. Just let `lang-xx-dictPath` point to the
    absolute path of the `.dic` file. Note that hunspell is quite slow when it
    comes to offering suggestions for misspelled words. 

#### Internal
  * Experimental: the new `default="temp_off"` attribute in `grammar.xml` files will
    turn off a rule/rulegroup, but keep it activated for our nightly regression tests.
  * Many external dependencies have been updated to new versions
